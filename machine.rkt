;; machine A structure that represents a fsm machine. This structure can represent any type of machine
;; - state-list { list-of-symbols }: A list of states that the machine can be in
;; - start-state { Symbol }: The state that the machine starts in 
;; - final-state-list { list-of-symbols }: A list of states that the machine can end in
;; - rule-list { list-of-list-of-symbols }: A list of rules that the machine must follow. Each rule should be defined as '(A a B).
;;       where A and B are states and a is a sigma.
;; - sigma-list { list-of-symbols }: A list of sigmas that act as instructions for the machine
;; - alpha-list { lis-of-symbols }: A list comtaining the machines alphabet 
;; - type { Symbol }: Represents the type of machine ex: (dfa, ndfa, pda, ...)
